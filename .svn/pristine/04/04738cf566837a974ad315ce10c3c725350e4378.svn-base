Once your IP interfaces have been configured, you can then designate which interface will be used as your connection to the public Internet (External + NAT) under the Interfaces tab.  For more information and examples, proceed to the <a href="InternetSharingHelp.html">Internet Sharing page</a> in IPNetRouterX Help.</p>		<p>To configure the built-in DHCP Server, select DHCP Server under the Tools menu.  To use the default settings, simply check &quot;DHCP Server On&quot;.</p>		<p>To configure IPNetRouterX as an AirPort software base station, select AirPort under the Tools menu.</p>		<p>Once you have created the desired configuration, save your settings to an IPNetRouterX document to restore them again later.</p>		<H2>Launching IPNetRouterX as a Mac OS X Startup Item</H2>		<p>Once you are comfortable IPNetRouterX is working as desired, you can configure it to launch as a Mac OS X startup item outside the context of any user login. To do this drag the &quot;IPNetRouterX_startup&quot; startup item in /Library/Application Support/IPNetRouterX/HelperTools to /Library/StartupItems.</p>		<p>You can launch IPNetRouterX from the Finder and select &quot;Tool-&gt;Expert View&quot; to see the currently running firewall status. If you encounter difficulty, you can restart while pressing the Shift key to prevent startup items from loading and then remove IPNetRouterX_startup from the /Library/StartupItems folder.</p>		<p>To install a newer version as a startup item, you can follow these steps:</p>		<ol>			<li type="1">Stop the previous startup item if running by killing the corresponding process.<br>				Drag the old startup item out of your /Library/StartupItems folder.			<li type="1">Force IPNetRouterX to create a new startup item by removing /Library/Application Support/IPNetRouterX/HelperTools.			<li type="1">Mount the new .dmg			<li type="1">Copy the app to your hard drive.			<li type="1">Run the app to complete the installation and verify it is working.			<li type="1">Drag the new startup item in /Library/Application Support/IPNetRouterX/HelperTools to /Library/StartupItems.			<li type="1">Restart your system, OR launch the app from the command line as: /Library/StartupItems/IPNetRouterX_startup/IPNetRouterX_startup		</ol>		<p>If you move the IPNetRouterX application on your hard drive, the IPNetRouterX_startup item may no longer find it. In this case you can generate a new startup item by removing /Library/Application Support/IPNetRouterX/HelperTools.</p>		<p>When launched as a startup item, IPNetRouterX will use the settings stored in the default location: /Library/Preferences/IPNetRouterX/com.sustworks.IPNetRouter.ipnr</p>		<hr>		<p><a href="RegistrationHelp.html">Previous</a> | <a href="preferencesHelp.html">Next</a> | <a href="../NMTitle.html">Return to IPNetRouterX Help</a></p>		<p></p>	</BODY></HTML>
