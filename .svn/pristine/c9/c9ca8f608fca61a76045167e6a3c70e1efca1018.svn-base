While well intentioned, these conventions are ofteninappropriate for a "personal" computer where a single user owns and administersthe system.  Among the operations that require such privileges are monitoringnetwork traffic.</P><P>IPNetRouterX takes the personal computer view that the user should normallybe in control of their computer, so tries to minimize the disruption of askingthe user to prove they are authorized to perform the requested operation.</P><P>To intercept and monitor network traffic, IPNetRouterX includes a tinyserver application named "LoadNKE" that must run as suid root. When IPNetRouterXis first run after being copied to a new location, it checks to see if the LoadNKEtool is present and set to suid root.  The same process is repeated for "RunTCPDump".If any of these tools are not authorized, IPNetRouterX asks you to authenticateso it can configure them to run as suid root. You might think of this as completing theinstallation process.  From that point on, no further authentication is necessaryto perform any of the restricted operations IPNetRouterX supports.</P><P><font size="2">Normally allowing small programs to execute as root is not a problem unless the program seeks to compromise your system or is exploited by another program to carry out such an attack. The best defense against such exploits at this time is to only run software from reputable developers. IPNetRouterX takes advantage of Leopard Code signing to alert you of any unintended modifications to the software.</font></P>		<p><font size="2">Security Administrators Note: The tools IPNetRouterX sets to be suid root are relatively safe because they do so little. Each tool performs one simple task like opening a raw socket. These tools are normally stored in /Library/Application Support/IPNetRouterX/HelperTools and are owned by root.</font></p>		<hr>		<p><a href="http://www.sustworks.com/site/prod_ipnrx_overview.html">Previous</a> | <a href="RegistrationHelp.html">Next</a> | <a href="../NMTitle.html">Return to IPNetRouterX Help</a></p>		<p></p>	</BODY></HTML>
