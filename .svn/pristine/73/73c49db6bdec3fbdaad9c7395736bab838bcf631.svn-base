To create a software base station you need to set the operating mode of the radio in the AirPort card itself. It is helpful to configure the AirPort data link before trying to set up Internet sharing because it may change the IP address of this interface.</P><P>Notice the radio used for AirPort can operate in one of three modes:</P><ul>	<li>Normal client mode</li>	<li>Access Point mode (base station)</li>	<li>Computer-to-computer mode</li></ul><P>The AirPort configuration tool allows you to select the desired operating mode,network name (for AP or Computer-to-computer mode), radio channel, encryption mode,and passphrase.  Press Apply to apply any changes you have made and add them to thecurrently open IPNetRouterX document.  Saving this document allows you to restorethese settings at a later time.</P>		<p><img src="AirPort1.gif" width="359" height="310"></p>		<p>Notice Apple does not currently support WPA (WiFi Protected Access) or WDS (Wireless Distribution System) for software base stations.  These might be welcome additions if Apple were   persuaded to support them.  WPA would allow software base stations to offer security similar to Apple's hardware base stations.  WDS is a system for relaying wireless signals using a single receiver and transmitter to extend the range of a wireless network through an Access Point that is not attached to a wired LAN.</p>		<hr>		<p><a href="AlternateRouteHelp.html">Previous</a> | <a href="FirewallConcepts.html">Next</a> | <a href="../NMTitle.html">Return to IPNetRouterX Help</a></p>		<p></p>	</BODY></HTML>
