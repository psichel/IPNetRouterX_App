Unix tcpdump has many options allowing you to specify in detail what packets you want to capture including protocols, interfaces, and link layer headers. The Options field accepts standard tcpdump options (&quot;-n -p -t&quot; for example to show numeric addresses, do not set promiscuous mode, and no time stamps). To learn more about the features of tcpdump, refer to the tcpdump <a href="http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=tcpdump&amp;apropos=0&amp;sektion=0&amp;manpath=FreeBSD+4.7-RELEASE&amp;format=html">manual page</a>available by typing "man tcpdump" from a terminal window.</font>		<P><font size="2">Naturally you can run tcpdump directly from a terminal window if desired. The reason to incorporate TCP Dump in IPNetRouterX is simple user convenience. You don't need to launch another application, be logged in as root, lookup the desired interface name, and IPNetRouterX remembers your options between launches.</font></P><P><font size="2">While TCP Dump is well suited to capturing packet headers and protocol information, it is less ideal for viewing the actual TCP data flow between a client and server. For this purpose, you can &quot;Use TCP Flow&quot; instead of TCP Dump. tcpflow is an open source utility distributed under GNU <a href="http://www.fsf.org/copyleft/gpl.html">General Public License</a>. IPNetRouterX includes a binary version of the tcpflow application built using &quot;DarwinPorts&quot; (v0.21, released 7 August 2003). When you select tcpflow, IPNetRouterX simply runs this command line tool (as is) and displays the output in a scroll view. You can learn more about tcpflow here: <a href="http://www.circlemud.org/%7ejelson/software/tcpflow/tcpflow.1.html">http://www.circlemud.org/~jelson/software/tcpflow/tcpflow.1.html .</a></font></P><P><font size="2">A popup menu keeps a list of recent Options or history. Thecontents of the options field are added to the list when tcpdumpis invoked. If the recent options menu becomes full (10 entries),the least recently used item will be removed. To add orremove an item, or clear the entire list, use the correspondingselections from the History menu.</font></P><P><font size="2">To help you remember what different options do, the TCP Dump tool allows you to append commentsseparated by "//" to your list of options.  The options history is pre-loaded with some commonexamples that show how to capture different information.</font></P><P><font size="2">You can open and use multiple TCP Dump windows at the same time.</font></P><h3><font size="2">Warning - Use tcpdump with caution</font></h3><P><font size="2">Tcpdump on Mac OS X has a known bug when trying tomonitor an interface that doesn't exist (may kernel panic).</font></P><P><font size="2">Setting an interface to promiscuous modeis not recommended when IP forwarding (Internet sharing or natd) is enabled sincethe BSD stack will try to forward packets that were not addressed to your machinecausing network confusion.</font></P>		<P><font size="2">As a safety precaution, TCP Dump is only authorized for users in the "admin" group.</font></P>		<font size="2">			<hr>		</font>		<p><font size="2"><a href="AddressScanHelp.html">Previous</a> | <a href="http://www.sustworks.com/site/prod_ipnrx_overview.html">Next</a> | <a href="../NMTitle.html">Return to IPNetRouterX Help</a></font></p>		<p></p>	</BODY> </HTML>
