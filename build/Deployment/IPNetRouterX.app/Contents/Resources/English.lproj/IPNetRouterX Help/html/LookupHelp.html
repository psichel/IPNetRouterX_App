Lookup uses the domainname system recursively by calling the local Resolver (lookupd) to find the correspondingname or address.</font></P><P><font size="2">In the context of IPNetRouterX, Lookup can be used to help determine IP addresses for filtering.</font></P><P><font size="2">After translating a name-to-address or address-to-name, the verification fieldshows the reverse lookup of the result.  Normally this will be the same asthe original target, but might be different if there is more than one namefor the same address or some other anomoly.</font></P><P><font size="2">Looking up a FQDN (Fully Qualified Domain Name) should return an A record (IP address). The verification step further returns the PTR record (if any) associated with the A record. Conversely, looking up an IP address should return a PTR record (if any), and if the PTR record exists, the verification step further returns the A record (IP address) associated with the PTR.</font></P><P><font size="2">Note that PTR records do not necessarily exist, and if they do, there is no requirement for a one-to-one correspondence with A records. Furthermore, there is a common technique for reverse delegation called "RFC 2317 classless delegation," in which the query answer includes both a CNAME as well as the desired PTR record. Unfortunately, the local Resolver typically returns only the CNAME. In this case, the CNAME is displayed in the verification field, and "RFC 2317 reverse delegation" is displayed in the status area of Lookup window. To get the complete answer including the PTR, one must resort to the Name Server Query tool.</font></P><H3><font size="2">Additional Features</font></H3><P><font size="2">When you invoke one window from another, the corresponding data isautomatically transferred so you don't need to re-enter it.</font></P><P><font size="2">A popup menu keeps a list of Recent Targets or history preloaded with some common values based on your network configuration. The contents of the target field are added to the list when a test to that target is invoked. If the recent targets menu becomes full (10 entries), the least recently used item will be removed. To add or remove an item, or clear the entire list, use the corresponding selections from the History menu. </font></P>		<P><font size="2">IPNetMonitorX recognizes the 'GURL' AppleEvent to handle URLs of the form:</font>		<pre><font size="2">	lookup://www.sustworks.com</font></pre>		<P><font size="2">You can open and use multiple Lookup windows at the same time.Resolver lookups are currently serialized under Mac OS X.</font></P>		<font size="2">			<hr>		</font>		<p><font size="2"><a href="FirewallProperties.html">Previous</a> | <a href="SubnetCalculatorHelp.html">Next</a> | <a href="../NMTitle.html">Return to IPNetRouterX Help</a></font></p>		<p></p>	</BODY></HTML>
